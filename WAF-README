Background

Waf is a build tool that manages all aspects of building software. You can find
waf here:

  http://waf.googlecode.com/

I suggest you read the Waf Book to find about waf and what it does. It is fast,
easy to program and additive. It uses Python as the scripting language so the
build scripts require a Python syntax. It also allows you to use the power of
Python and its full programming language to implement a build system with the
same approach you design the software you embed on RTEMS. Just because it is a
build system does not mean you are limited to using design techniques, tools
and scripting formats from 30 years ago.

RTEMS Module

The rtems.py and pkgconfig.py provide the support you need. Place these files
in the top of your source tree where you will add your wscript file. You need
to add a wscript. This example is for a simple hello world program (source not
provided):

 import rtems

 def init(ctx):
     rtems.init(ctx)

 def options(opt):
     rtems.options(opt)

 def configure(conf):
     rtems.configure(conf)

 def build(bld):
     rtems.build(bld)
     bld.program(target = 'hello-world',
                 features = 'cprogram',
                 source = 'main.c')
